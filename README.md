# Notes Demo 2

A simple CRUD type Spring API for notes.

Uses OAuth2 authentication, which was setup for demo purposes with a simple Auth0 configuration for real JWT auth+validation.
However, any OAuth2 resource server can be used (Auth0, Keycloak, even running a simple Keycloak server locally in a container will do the trick!)

This was an older project, missing parts, and needs some TLC... more to come when I dig up the pieces.
